breeze (4:5.0.0-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * New upstream release

  [ Scarlett Clark ]
  * Update watch to http://download.kde.org 

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * breeze-icon-theme now depends oxygen-icon-theme. Latter is used as a
    fallback, since breeze on its own does not cover as many icons as oxygen
    does.
  * breeze now depends kde-style-qtcurve5 as it is the style engine of
    choice
  * breeze now recommends kde-style-qtcurve4 as kde4breeze migrator will try
    to enable theme convergence between qt5 and qt4 by using qtcurve, to
    facilitate this we need the qt4 theme on installations
